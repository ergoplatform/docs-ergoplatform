# The Ergo Protocol

Ergo is a UTXO based blockchain with Proof-of-Work consensus. In this aspect it is similar to Bitcoin. Ergo uses standard Elliptic Curve Cryptography and the exact same curve as Bitcoin (Secp256k1). Unlike Bitcoin and similar to Cardano, Ergo uses the so called "extended-UTXO model", which implies UTXOs with the ability to contain arbitrary data and sophisticated scripts. Due to this, Ergo supports advanced financial contracts similar to those in Ethereum's account-based model.
